# Treehouse Student Dashboard

A [dashboard](http://danie11edotcom.github.io/TreehousePoints/) that displays an achievement (badges earned) timeline and a bar graph of points earned by subject for Treehouse students.

## How It Works
Enter your [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) student profile name to see your profile picture and points earned by category.

Not a Treehouse student? No problem. Enter daniellehill2 and checkout my stats to see the dashboard in action.

## How It Looks
