# Treehouse Student Dashboard

A dashboard that displays an achievement timeline based on badges earned and a bar graph of points earned by subject for Treehouse students.

## How It Works
Click <a href= "http://danie11edotcom.github.io/TreehousePoints/" target="_blank">here</a> to open the dashboard in a new window. To display your profile information, enter your [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) student profile name in the search bar and press Enter or click Search.

Not a Treehouse student? No problem. Enter daniellehill2 and checkout my stats to see the dashboard in action. Interested in seeing more profiles? Try these names:
- chalkers
- davemcfarland
- kennethlove
